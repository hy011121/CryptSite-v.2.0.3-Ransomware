### CryptSite v.2.0.3 - Ransomware

**Lock all files and databases with CryptSite v.2.0.3 ransomware!**

---

#### **1. File Encryption Script (`ency`)**

**Description**:
This script encrypts every file in directory using an algorithm. Each original file is deleted after it is encrypted, ensuring the data is only accessible after the decryption process. With the specific file exclusion feature, you can control which files remain untouched. The encryption results are saved with the extension `.clle01`, indicating that the file is locked and can only be accessed after decryption is complete.

---

#### **2. File Decryption Script (`decy`)**

**Description**:
Decrypts files that have been encrypted using the `ency` script, returning them to their original form. This process ensures that only the party who has the encryption key can access the locked file. This script scans the target directory for files with the extension `.clle01` and decrypts them automatically.

---

#### **3. Database Encryption Script (`encryption`)**

**Description**:
This script encrypts data in every column in every table in a MySQL database. Using a predefined encryption key, each value is converted into an encrypted form that cannot be read without a proper decryption process. The log file will track all activity, ensuring you know which tables and columns were successfully encrypted.

---

#### **4. Database Decryption Script (`decryption`)**

**Description**:
Decrypts data in each column in each table that has been encrypted using `encryption`. This script ensures data is restored to its original form only if the same encryption key is used. Errors that occur during the decryption process will be tracked in a log file, providing complete control over the decryption process.

### **Features of CryptSite v.2.0.3:**
- **Powerful Encryption**: Uses algorithms and multiple encryption to ensure files and data in the database are completely locked.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks all encryption and decryption activities to ensure transparency and control.
- **Selective Encryption**: Ability to exclude certain files from the encryption process, providing flexibility and control.
- **Automated Process**: Fully automated encryption and decryption process, making execution and management easy.

### **Web PHP Integration with Terminal-like Environment**
Using CryptSite PHP Shell Terminal, you can integrate CryptSite v.2.0.3 scripts into a PHP web environment. This terminal allows script execution directly from the web interface, providing full control over encryption and decryption of files and databases over the web.

So unlike CryptSite v.1.0.3 which stopped because it was unable to encrypt many files at once, this version allows encryption and execution to be carried out simultaneously without problems. This script not only avoids file corruption but also ensures the server remains stable throughout the process.

**Warning: This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Misuse of this tool for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized data encryption, is illegal and unethical. Always use cybersecurity tools responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.**

Encrypt everything with CryptSite v.2.0.3 ransomware!
